1. Hopefully that worked for you, But there are some problems that may come up:
   1. **"My friend cant see my website, Even though I gave him my IP Address!"** Make sure your friend is on the same wifi as you, The IP Address that you got is your _private IP address_ that means that it is only accessible from inside your own network. If you wanted anyone in the world to be able to use your website, You need a public IP address. Unfortunately, Most residential internet providers wont give you one. But don't worry, There are lots of solutions! The easiest being: Host in the cloud. If you host your website in a virtual server, You can have a public IP! And most of the Cloud hosting people will give you a small virtual server for free! Check out: [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) or [Google Cloud Compute](https://cloud.google.com/compute/)! You could also use a service like [noip.com: http://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/getting-started-with-no-ip-com/](http://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/getting-started-with-no-ip-com/)
   2. **"My friend still cant see my website, And we are on the same WiFi!"** If you are on wifi that you don't own\( Like public WiFi \), They might have _client isolation_ turned on for security, If you want, You could try using a hotspot on your phone!
