1. So you have gotten a basic web server, But you are probably wondering what the point of programming it is, Why not just download a web-server to host your web server?
2. As you may have seen in the Javascript tutorial, You can store things in the users browser, But thats not much good if you need to share things. Think about Facebook, How does that work?

To do this we are going to make an _API_.
