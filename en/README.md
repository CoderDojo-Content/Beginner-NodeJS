1. Before doing this card you should have completed the Javascript and HTML Sushi Cards\( Or be Familiar with Javascript and HTML \). If not, Go find them [here](https://www.gitbook.com/@coderdojo).

2. To develop with NodeJS, You are going to need to install the enviroment to your computer. Download and run the installer for your operating system [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

3. You will also need an editor, We recommend [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/), But you can use another text editor if you prefer.

4. You now have the tools needed to develop with NodeJS, To get started, Make a new folder on your computer for this project and open a new text file called _main.js_ \(Javascript program files have the extension .js\).

5. Open up a command line\( Called _Command Prompt_ on windows and _Terminal_ on Mac. \) and navigate to the folder you just made by using the _cd_ command.

6. When you have done that type in

```bash
node main.js
```

If you see no error messages you are ready to start programming in NodeJS!

_\(On some machines you may need to type nodejs instead of node. Also: To shut down a program in the terminal, press ctrl-c on a mac or ctrl-x on a windows machine. \)_
