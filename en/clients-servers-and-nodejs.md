1. When developing websites, You have to understand _clients_ and _servers_. Simply put, A client is the web browser on someones laptop or phone, And a server is a computer somewhere that _hosts_ the website. Normally, When you go to a website like facebook, your computer or phone sends a message through a big network of computers and cables, Eventually that message gets to a server somewhere in the world\( Normally in a huge building full of computers \), Then that server sends the HTML and Javascript code of that website back to your device, Which shows the website.
2. In this tutorial, The NodeJS program you are going to run in your computer is the _server_ and your web-browser is the _client_, Even though they are on the same computer, But if any of your friends go to your [private ip address](https://www.howtogeek.com/236838/how-to-find-any-devices-ip-address-mac-address-and-other-network-connection-details/) they will be able to be a client as well!
