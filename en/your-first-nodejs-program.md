1. In the text editor, Type

   ```
   console.log("Hello, World!");
   ```

   And run the program! You should see "Hello World" print out in the terminal.

2. **Packages:** Sometimes you will need to do something complex\( Like hosting a website. \). And while you could write it all yourself, Its likely that someone will have already made a library to help you do this. To install _librarys_ in NodeJS, We use _NPM_, A package manager.

3. We are going to install [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/), a library that makes writing web applications much easier. To install express, Type this in to the command prompt:

   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

4. Hopefully that installed correctly, Now you are ready to start making a web server!
