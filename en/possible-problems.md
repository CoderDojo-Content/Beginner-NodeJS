1. Hopefully that worked for you, But there are some problems that may come up:
   1. **"My friend cant see my website, Even though I gave him my IP Address!"** Make sure your friend is on the same wifi as you, The IP Address that you got is your _private IP address_ that means that it is only accessible from inside your own network. If you wanted anyone in the world to be able to use your website, You need a public IP address. Unfortunately, Most residential internet providers wont give you one. But don't worry, There are lots of solutions! The easiest being: Host in the cloud. If you host your website in a virtual server, You can have a public IP! And most of the Cloud hosting people will give you a small virtual server for free! Check out: [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) or [Google Cloud Compute](https://cloud.google.com/compute/)!
   2. **"My friend still cant see my website, And we are on the same WiFi!"** If you are on wifi that you don't own\( Like public WiFi \), They might have _client isolation_ turned on for security, If you want, You could try using a hotspot on your phone!
   3. **"My website was working earlier, And now its broken!"** If you are using a different wifi network, Your private IP may have changed! Or, If you disconnected from the WiFi, The router may have given your IP to someone else. Try to find out your IP again and update your code!
